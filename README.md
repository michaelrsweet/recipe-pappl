Yocto Recipe for the Printer Application Framework (PAPPL)
==========================================================

This repository contains a [Yocto][1] recipe for building [PAPPL][2] for your
embedded Linux printing projects.  PAPPL is a simple C-based framework/library
for developing CUPS Printer Applications, which are the recommended replacement
for printer drivers.  When used in an embedded Linux environment, it is possible
to make existing (or new!) printers compatible with basically all mobile and
desktop operating systems with a single printer application.

PAPPL also supports the Linux USB gadget API so that your embedded device can be
connected to a desktop computer and show up as a regular USB printer.
